Are you tired of phantoms eating you up in your singleplayer world?
 - Well, look no further!

With *Phantom Switch* you can disable all those nasty phantoms from your world.

Here's the crafting recipe for the Phantom disabler block:

You might be asking -- Why is it so expensive to craft?
  - It's because the mod's purpose is that players don't feel guilty
  when they disable the phantoms. 
  Otherwise, they you could just download some random NoPhantoms mod.

## Versions
Currently the mod is only supporting 1.21 and 1.21.1, but I plan to update it to 1.21.3 in the very near future.


This is a fairly new project so every download is appreciated!
